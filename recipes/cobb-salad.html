        <p>A Cobb salad is an American dish that consists of lettuce topped with 
            bacon, chicken, boiled eggs, tomatoes, and other ingredients arranged in 
            neat rows. It is traditionally served as a main course. The origins of the 
            classic salad is unclear, but many believe it was created in the late 1930s 
            at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. Stolen from
